# Accessible Text Reader

A Java application that reads text files aloud, developed as part of an academic activity on inclusive technologies.

## üìã About the Project

This project was developed as an alternative activity for the Computer Programming course in the ADS program at IFSP-Caraguatatuba, in the context of the institutional event celebrating the World Day for Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development (May 21, 2025).

The central theme of the event was "Connections that Transform: Cultural Diversity and Technological Inclusion" and inspired the creation of this accessible text reader, designed as a tool for people with visual impairments.
